            <h2 class="section-title">The Problem: Outdated Education Model</h2>
            <p>The traditional education system remains largely unchanged despite rapid technological advancements and evolving workforce demands. Professors often rely on rigid curricula that fail to accommodate individual learning paces, leading to disengagement and inefficiencies in knowledge retention.</p>
            <p>Students today require a more personalized learning experience that adapts to their strengths and weaknesses. The one-size-fits-all approach fails to prepare learners for modern industries, where skills evolve at an unprecedented rate.</p>

        <section id="solution">
            <h2 class="section-title">Solution: Modern Path to Workforce Readiness</h2>

            <h3>Coursera</h3>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Offers online courses from universities and industry leaders across various disciplines.</p>
            <p><strong>Competitive Advantage:</strong> While Coursera provides high-quality courses, it lacks continuous customization. Skill Bridge uses AI-driven feedback loops to tailor the learning experience uniquely for each student.</p>
            
            <h3>Khan Academy</h3>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Provides free educational resources with a data-driven feedback mechanism to personalize learning paths.</p>
            <p><strong>Competitive Advantage:</strong> Unlike Khan Academyâ€™s video-centric approach, Skill Bridge enables real-time AI interactions, mimicking human tutoring for a more dynamic, two-way learning experience.</p>
